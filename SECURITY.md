# 🔒 Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Stream-Syntra follows semantic versioning. Security updates are provided for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | ✅ Fully supported |
| 0.x.x   | ⚠️ Development only |

## 🛡️ Security Features

### **🔐 Current Security Measures**

- **Container Isolation**: All services run in isolated Docker containers
- **Network Segmentation**: Internal container networking with controlled port exposure
- **Authentication**: Grafana dashboard protected with credentials
- **Access Control**: QuestDB console and Kafka Connect API accessible only via configured ports
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration managed through environment variables

### **🚨 Known Security Considerations**

This is a **development and learning platform**. For production deployment:

- **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication for all services
- **TLS/SSL**: Enable encryption for all inter-service communication
- **Network Security**: Use proper firewall rules and network policies
- **Access Control**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Secrets Management**: Use dedicated secrets management solutions
- **Monitoring**: Implement security monitoring and alerting

## 🔍 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step reproduction instructions
- **Environment**: Version information and environment details
- **Fix Suggestion**: If you have a proposed solution

### **⏱️ Response Timeline**

- **24 hours**: Initial acknowledgment
- **72 hours**: Initial assessment and severity classification
- **7 days**: Detailed response with timeline for fix
- **30 days**: Target resolution for critical vulnerabilities

### **🏆 Recognition**

Security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities will be:
- **Credited**: In release notes and security advisories (if desired)
- **Recognized**: In our security hall of fame
- **Connected**: LinkedIn recommendations for significant findings

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### **🏭 Production Deployment Security**

If deploying Stream-Syntra in production environments:

#### **🔐 Authentication & Authorization**

```yaml
# Example: Grafana with authentication
environment:
  - GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=secure_random_password
  - GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ENABLED=false
  - GF_AUTH_BASIC_ENABLED=true
```

#### **🔑 TLS/SSL Configuration**

```yaml
# Example: QuestDB with TLS
environment:
  - QDB_HTTP_TLS_ENABLED=true
  - QDB_HTTP_TLS_CERT_PATH=/path/to/cert
  - QDB_HTTP_TLS_KEY_PATH=/path/to/key
```

#### **🌐 Network Security**

```yaml
# Example: Restricted network access
networks:
  stream_syntra_internal:
    driver: bridge
    internal: true
  stream_syntra_public:
    driver: bridge
```

#### **🔒 Secrets Management**

```bash
# Use Docker secrets instead of environment variables
echo "my_secret_token" | docker secret create github_token -
```

### **🔍 Security Scanning**

We recommend regular security scanning:

#### **🐳 Container Security**

```bash
# Scan Docker images for vulnerabilities
docker scan questdb/questdb:8.3.1
docker scan confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.7.0
docker scan grafana/grafana-oss:11.2.0
```

#### **📦 Dependency Scanning**

```bash
# Python dependencies
pip-audit

# Node.js dependencies  
npm audit

# Java dependencies
mvn org.owasp:dependency-check-maven:check
```

### **📊 Security Monitoring**

Implement monitoring for:

- **Failed Authentication**: Track failed login attempts
- **Unusual Access Patterns**: Monitor for suspicious data access
- **Resource Usage**: Watch for abnormal resource consumption
- **Network Traffic**: Monitor inter-service communication
- **Data Exfiltration**: Track large data downloads

### **🔄 Regular Updates**

Keep all components updated:

```bash
# Update Docker images regularly
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d

# Monitor for security advisories
# - QuestDB: https://github.com/questdb/questdb/security/advisories
# - Kafka: https://kafka.apache.org/cve-list
# - Grafana: https://grafana.com/security/
```
